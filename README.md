## :bookmark: About

This project is a part of GoStack Bootcamp by [Rocketseat](https://rocketseat.com.br/).

Our goal was to create an application for practice what we learned about Node.js with TypeScript, using concepts of models, services and repositories.

This is an application to store incoming and outgoing financial transactions, which should allow the registration and listing of these transactions.

## :books: Documentation

This challenge was tested using the following tests:

- [x] should be able to create a new transaction
- [x] should be able to list the transactions
- [x] should not be able to create outcome transaction without a valid balance
